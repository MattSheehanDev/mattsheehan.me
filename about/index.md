#### Hi ####

My name's Matt. I live in Ohio by a lake and some trees with my laptop and bicycle.
Sometimes I even update this page when I'm not working on some side project or watching *House* or *Seinfeld*.

I started programming after first wanting to learn how to make a website (it was a tribute to Bruce Springsteen btw and it was terrible). I then made a few really bad html games, followed by a few more projects between the years, some of which I have been really proud of at the time and others that make me wonder what I was thinking. Since then my interests have moved into other areas of computer science, such as language design, embedded systems, program architecture, and artificial intelligence. None of these things determine what I write about though. I write infrequently and whatever I'm currently thinking about.

If you want to get involved in a project, send me a note at sheehamj@outlook.com.
