I'm not quite sure how '3D touch' works, but I'm assuming it works a lot like force touch on the new Macbook. If that's the case, this is the coolest feature in a phone since touch screens became popular. This is cooler than Siri, Touch ID, and a 12MP camera combined. A touch screen that simulates clicking fixes all of my complaints with touchscreens. Gaming on your phone? Now you have better buttons. Typing on your phone? Now you have a better keyboard. This will improve touch accuracy by 300% (I might be making that number up, I honestly think most of my typing errors are made by me just clunkily trying to hit tiny buttons of my phone and not realizing if I hit the right button or even hit the button at all. Hell, isn't that why autocompletion and autocorrect were added?). Some might say the iPhone 6s won't be as great as the iPhone 6 was, and that might be true in terms of sales, but the 6s is leaps and bounds ahead of the 6. I am excited about the iPhone for the first time since the iPhone 4s.

This is definitely a rip off from the Microsoft Surface Pro 3. But a few details worthy of remark are the starting price of $800 (+ $99 for the stylus 'pencil' + the price of the keyboard), which is probably a better machine than the $800 Surface Pro 3 with a Core i3 but is quickly eclipsed by the Surface Pro 3 once any upgrade in RAM, SSD, or processor is added, and the kickstand. Microsoft made the decision to add the kickstand as part of the 'tablet' while the iPad Pro retains the traditional iPad look, and adds the kickstand as part of the keyboard attachment. I actually think having the kickstand as part of the keyboard was a better decision.
