Bernie Sanders reminds be of Ellsworth Toohey from *The Fountainhead*. And if you've never read *The Fountainhead*, Mr. Toohey was the villain. The vanguard of equality and love, or so he says. That government should be the great equalizer and that the people who have risked success don't deserve it.

<blockquote>
Such is the nature of sums and quests for the lowest comon denominator. What, then, is the residue of many human minds put together, unaired, unspaced, undifferentiated.
</blockquote>


When did we stop celebrating human achievement? How can someone else have any stake in what I earn, in what I make? And when did we start pointing fingers at the rich? If anyone thinks that the more one person has, the less I can have, does not understand microeconomics. Wealth is not a zero sum game. Nobody has to lose for a few people to win, and nobody won by forcing someone else to lose.

<blockquote>
	As a matter of fact, the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind. He expects nothing of men, so no form of depravity can outrage him.
</blockquote>

Let me give an example. If I buy 1 stock at $40, and the next day that stock goes to $50. Did I call the Federal Reserve and tell them to print more money for me? Did I rob someone of $10 and now some poor immigrant is $10 poorer? No. Wealth was created. Wealth was created and nobody had to lose (of course if you were shorting the stock, then you would have lost, but nobody *had* to lose). This is how the rich stay rich. Not necessarily stocks, but by __creating wealth__.


Bernie Sanders has never created wealth in his life. Nothing is new or better or stronger because of him. He wants things to be stagnant. He wants things to be worse than stagnant, he wants things to *be fair and equal*. To hell with your harder work! Someone else needs your money more than you do!

We should be rewarded by what we create, not by what we don't create. Some people create art, for some it's music, and some others create wealth. Those are our choices, nobody forced our hands when we majored in art history.

<blockquote>
	Mr. Roark, we're alone here. Why don't you tell me what you think of me? In any words you wish. No one will hear you.
	But I don't think of you.
</blockquote>


How come we give so many people who don't deserve our attention, our attention? How come we care at all what other people think of us? Don't shame me because I'm fat! Don't shame me because I'm skinny! Don't shame me because I'm neither fat nor skinny! Bernie Sanders would tell you that all these shouts have equal weight in their validity. But that's impossible, being fat has to be worse than being skinny, and being skinny has to be worse than being healthy. And people should make up for themselves what they want to be. 

People should have self-respect, not necessarily my respect and not necessarily your respect, but their own respect. Noboby can shame that, regardless of what you hear or what is said about you.

<blockquote>
	We are all brothers under the skin--and I, for one, would be willing to skin humanity to prove it.
</blockquote>


Bernie Sanders thinks that we're all just here to be fertilizer. Fertilizer for the hopeful success of other people. Fertilizer to help other people reach their enlightenment. But what about our own? I am not fertilizer for anybody else. What is shared, is shared from the charity of my own heart, and because it merits my charity, not because I was told it merits my charity. Or that it merits part of my paycheck.


Bernie Sanders does not want to bind us together through the triumph of human achievement that we all experience when we see a hundred story skyscraper. He would rather see us seperated through guilt shaming.
