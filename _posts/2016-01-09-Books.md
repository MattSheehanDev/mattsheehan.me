Whenever I think of my favorite books, I always come up with this short list. Then I wonder, are these still my favorite books? I probably haven't read some of these for years and who knows what I was thinking about when I read some of them. So since I consider these my favorite books, and I generally don't re-read books (except a few), I think all of these deserve a second reading to see if they still make the cut.

  * [✓] Never Out of Season -- David W. Hunter[^1]
  * [ ] The Fountainhead -- Ayn Rand
  * [ ] The Master and Margarita -- Mikhail Bulgakov
  * [ ] Lexicon -- Max Barry
  * [ ] The Wolf of Wall Street -- Jordan Belfort

[^1]: I read *Never Out of Season* right when I was out of college and it has been the essential guiding tool in whenever I think about finances. Three years later, the book is even more meaningful since ideas have larger consequences when implemented with more money.
