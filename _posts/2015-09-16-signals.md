Here's some things I read this week.

[The Shape of Things to Come](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come)
{: .subtitle}

An article from earlier this year featuring Jony Ive and his influence over Apple's design over the last decade culminating into the latest product, the Apple Watch.


[World Without End](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian)
{: .subtitle}

Another article from earlier this year from the New Yorker featuring the procedurally generated video game, No Man's Sky. 


[Growing a Programmer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/Thoughts/Growing_a_Programmer.html)
{: .subtitle}

An interesting pragmatic look of CS coursework, focusing more on the design and architecture of complex software.

[The Apple iOS 9 Review](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9605/the-ios-9-review)
{: .subtitle}

I just like anandtech for their long reads. I'll probably do an iOS 9 review after I download it.


[Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/)
{: .subtitle}

I didn't actually find this this week, but I still wanted to share it because of it's helpful 'learn by example' layout.
