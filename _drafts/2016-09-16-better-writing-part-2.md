*__TL;DR__: Deliberate and focused practive never gets easier, but it does make you better.*

It could be my delusions, but I think I'm a pretty good coder and a pretty lousy writer. And that's no coincidence. I have spent a lot of time doing one and just praying that I wake up better at the other (I also get paid to code so that's a strong motivater, EVERYONE needs money). Deliberate practice has made me a good developer, but it could have very easily have been different. Imagine a world in which I was a great author but yet I didn't know anything about bubble sort![^1].

The catch is, there's only so much time, making it impossible to be good at everything. 
So how do you get better at the things that are important to you? How do you get better at writing? drawing? coding?

How do you get better at anything?
Deliberate practice. The kind of practice that takes all of your attention and focus. It's the kind of practicing that holds people back from being the best at anything, because deliberate practice is **really hard**.

Deliberate practice means saying yes to the things that further your long term goals and saying no to the more fun things. A group of friends are going out for drinks Friday after work? Sorry I have to make time to _practice_. To be fair, you don't need to live with a stick up your ass, but laissez-faire discipline doesn't work either.

As a way to take my thoughts and make them more concrete, it helps if I write them out. So I've written down a few things that help me stay focused so that I can make the most out of the time that I have for practicing the skills that are important to me.

1. _Stick to a schedule_. Ex. "I'm going to do _abc_ every Tuesday and Thursday". I like this, but it's not the keeping a schedule part I like, it's the idea that in order to get something done, you just have to do it. It doesn't matter what the circumstances are, you do the job that needs to be done and you don't think twice about it.
2. _Tell your plan to other people so that they will hold you accountable_. This will only work if you are very single minded and have friends that don't mind you repeating yourself. I've found this to work best when everyone shares the same goal too.
3. _Take notes_. Since time is long and my memory is finite, I never go anywhere whithout at least one notebook and sometimes two.

4. _Don't be afraid of the middle_. Have you ever looked at what someone else made and feel terrible about what you're currently working on? That's because you haven't seen their middle. You haven't seen all the effort and rethinking and rewrites that went into that final work. They're finished work may look more polished, but their process was just as confusing. Continually work on your polish, but don't compare someone else's finished work to your work in progress.[^2]
5. _Make mistakes (but don't dwell on them)_. If you go looking for mistakes, you'll always find them. It's kind of like trouble. If your goal is to find some trouble for yourself then you'll never have a problem. The point is, it's easy to see your own flaws when you're working on something, but more often then not that's not what other people see.[^3]


[^1]: What is bubble sort again??
[^2]: But don't settle for second best either.
[^3]: Seriously meet my mom sometime, she'll tell you I've never made a mistake.
